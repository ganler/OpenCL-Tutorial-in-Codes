## Add `cl.hpp` to use C++ as your front end not C.

Add [cl.hpp](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/api/2.1/cl.hpp) to your include directories.

- For linux: `sudo cp cl.hpp /usr/includes/CL`
- For OS X: Cancel SIP if you are in higher OS X version, then do the same thing with `/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Headers`
